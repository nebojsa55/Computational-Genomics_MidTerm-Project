# Preterm Birth Prediction Challenge

This project was completed as part of the [Computational Genomics](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en/fis/karton_predmeta/13M111GI-2013#gsc.tab=0) course at University of Belgrade, [School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en).

The goal of the projects was to predict gestational age in pregnant woman, by analyzing gene expression. **Regression method** was utilized to try and build sucessfull machine learning model

The data used was from **DREAM Preterm Birth prediction challenge**. *To learn more click on the picture above*

Data stats:

| Total num of samples  |    Train samples |  Testing samples |Number of features|
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:--------:|
| 735 |  367 | 368 |32 830|

*DISCLAIMER*:
Gestational age in testing data was not provided, due to the nature of the challenge. Because of that, this model was implemented using only 367 samples from original training set.
